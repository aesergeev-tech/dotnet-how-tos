# Open/Closed Principle Examples in C#

This project contains practical, illustrative examples of the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** â€” the "O" in the SOLID acronym. The core idea of the principle is that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be **open for extension, but closed for modification**.

Instead of dry theory, this repository demonstrates how to achieve OCP using three classic design patterns. Each pattern is implemented in a separate, self-contained project.

## Demonstrated Patterns

1.  **[Strategy Pattern](./StrategyPattern/)**
    *   **Use Case:** When you have a family of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors that can be selected at runtime.
    *   **Example:** A `PaymentProcessor` that can handle various payment methods (credit card, PayPal) without needing modification when a new method is added.

2.  **[Decorator Pattern](./DecoratorPattern/)**
    *   **Use Case:** When you need to add new responsibilities to objects dynamically and transparently.
    *   **Example:** An `Order` processing system where you can add extra options like gift wrapping or express shipping without altering the base `Order` class.

3.  **[Factory Method Pattern](./FactoryMethodPattern/)**
    *   **Use Case:** When a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create and delegates their creation to subclasses or a helper class.
    *   **Example:** A `ReportFactory` that can create different types of reports (`PDF`, `Excel`), where the client code does not need to know the concrete classes of the reports being created.
